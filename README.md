# Bare-Bones Web Application

This is a minimal web application built with React and Chakra UI. It serves as a starting point for building more complex applications.

## Features

- Basic HTML structure
- Simple CSS for styling
- Basic JavaScript setup

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd bare-bones-app
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the application locally, use the following command:
```sh
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:
```sh
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `build` directory.

### Modifying the Application

- The main entry point of the application is `src/Index.jsx`.
- You can modify the styling using Chakra UI components and CSS.
- Add new features and components as needed.
